/* HOW THIS WORKS
 In order to encourage customization, I'm going to try to describe exactly how it works
 
- Design/Build
     RKSwipeBetweenViewControllers is a custom UINavigationController
     with UIButtons as tabs and a UIView as the slider that moves around
     
     The class builds a standard UIPageViewController with the 
     controllers in "viewControllerArray" and dynamically adjusts the 
     buttons according to how many objects there are. (i.e. if there are 
     2 controllers, there will be 2 tabs, and the slider will be 
     width/2-buffer/2 wide)
     
     The buttons are automatically placed evenly across the navigation bar, 
     but you can adjust placement and size with the x/y buffers or the
     height of the buttons
 
 
- Swiping
    - Correct ViewController
     Swiping between pages calls the delegate functions:
     (UIViewController *)pageViewController:(UIPageViewController *)pageViewController 
        viewControllerBeforeViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController
     
     and
     
     (UIViewController *)pageViewController:(UIPageViewController *)pageViewController 
        viewControllerAfterViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController
     
     These are actually not as intuitive as you would think, because if you 
     swipe once, it calls both functions so that it can build and maintain 
     the pages (i think). This means it isn't a simple solution of "get me the 
     next page", you have to check what page you are on and then return that 
     page from the viewControllerArray
     
     So, this is possible by maintaining a "currentPageIndex".  Whenever the 
     user calls a swipe command, the delegate function
     
     (void)pageViewController:(UIPageViewController *)pageViewController didFinishAnimating
        (BOOL)finished previousViewControllers:(NSArray *)previousViewControllers 
        transitionCompleted:(BOOL)completed
     
     is called, and here I check to see if the action is completed 
     (you can stop mid-swipe and swipe back), and then check the index 
     of the page i'm on.
 
    - Moving the Selector / Slider
     In the function "syncScrollView", I grab the UIPageViewController's
     UIScrollView, and then I set the delegate to this custom class
     
     So, whenever you move the pages, 
     (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)scrollView is called.
     Here I can measure how far you are moving the page with "xFromCenter"
     and then adjust the UIView for the slider accordingly
 
 
- Tapping Tabs
    - Changing Pages
     I've set up the buttons so that they each have a tag number (left = 0).
     And I've attached the function "tapSegmentButtonAction" to each button
     So, when you tap a button, it checks the tag, and that's the index of
     the controller you want in the viewControllerArray.  But, if it jumped
     straight to it, you wouldn't get an understanding of the pages in between
     and it wouldn't feel right.  So, I've constructed a loop that shows every
     controller in viewControllerArray from where you are to where you have to
     go.
 
    - Moving the Slider
     When you click a tab, because it scrolls through the pages until it gets
     to the page you want, it calls "scrollViewDidScroll", which takes care of
     moving the slider. So, the formula for movement is i*c+x. i is 320/number
     of tabs (i.e. width of 1 tab), c is the current page index and x is change
     in the scrollView's x coordinates. For example, if I'm on the 2nd tab and 
     I scroll to the 4th tab, the slider has to move from 80*1+0 to 80*3+0
 
- Lag when you first swipe through your view controllers
     The reason this happens is because of the way UIPageViewController works.
     I actually implemented my own custom class, but realized it would get
     more confusing, and require people to spend more time learning how to use
     this, so I got rid of it.  
 
     So, when you use a UIPageViewController and you swipe, it builds the
     entire controller and then shows it to you.  That means if you have
     a UITableViewController, it has to build the first x number of cells.
     If you have photos or lots of data, this can take a while.
 
     The primary way to get around this is to run all of your custom setup
     in the background.  There are tons of ways and tons of tutorials on this
     already, so I won't get into detail.
